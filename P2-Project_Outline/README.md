# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

"Helping Hands" is an idea that will change how you give away items you don't need.
Instead of leaving your old dresser on your curb, you can now list it online, free 
for the taking.

As well as listing your own items, you can search for others'. Users of this website will
find it incredibly easy to decrease the clutter in their house and can reduce their expenses
by acquiring what they need for free. 

### Features

1. Account creation - An account will allow you to list your haves and needs: items you are
    willing to give away and items you want.
   
2. Search - The search functionality will show users that have what you need and need what
    you have. Exact ideas for the search functionality have not yet been finalized; they
    may be changed later.
   
3. Profile view - Allows users to view other users' profiles. Lists haves and needs as well
    as their location. More features may be added to this section as we develop the site.
   
4. Settings - Not sure what functionality this will have, although one that comes to mind 
    is a distance limit.
   
### Technologies

Not finalized, but:

Java (certain)
React (Our group members are working in React right now, so most likely)
MySQL (most likely)

### What I'll Have to Learn

Using Java and React together.
