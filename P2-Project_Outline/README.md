Overview:

One Feed is a social media website that aims to condense and simplify the annoyance and clutter of modern day social media. We aim to do this by creating a website that will track users' social media accounts and combine them into 'one feed' on a single website page. The idea came from being overwhelmed by the continuous emergence of social media platforms that are essentially the same.

What youâ€™ll have to learn:

Most of the learning will be in regards to API, however revisiting angular could prove to be a re-learning experience as it was used briefly in the first unit of LaunchCode 101.
